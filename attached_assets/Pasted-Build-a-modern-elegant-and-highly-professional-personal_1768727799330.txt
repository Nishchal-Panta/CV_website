🎯 Website Goals

Recruiter-ready, elegant, and minimal

Demonstrates core web fundamentals, not frameworks

Shows real CI/CD usage through the codebase

Suitable for internships, junior developer roles, and technical review

🧱 Technology Stack (Mandatory)

The website must be built using only:

HTML5 – semantic, accessible structure

CSS3 – layout, responsiveness, typography, theming, 
Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.

Vanilla JavaScript – used only for:

Animations

Transitions

Small UI interactions (modals, scroll effects, navigation)

❌ No frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
✔ Clean, well-organized vanilla code

🧱 Required Sections (UI)
1. Hero Section

Full name and professional title

Short, impactful tagline

CTA buttons:

View Projects

⚙️ Mandatory CI/CD & Engineering Requirements (Code-Level)

The repository must implement CI/CD pipelines, not just describe them.

CI/CD Expectations:

Use GitHub Actions

Trigger on:

Push to main branch

Pull requests

Pipeline should include:

HTML/CSS/JS validation or linting

Build/prepare step (if needed)

Artifact generation (if applicable)

Automated deployment configuration

Deployment:

Deploy to a static hosting platform (e.g., GitHub Pages preferred)

Clean separation of source and deploy output

No secrets committed to the repo

Repository Quality:

Logical folder structure

Meaningful commits

README explaining:

Tech stack choice

CI/CD workflow

Deployment process

🎨 Design & UX Guidelines

Modern typography

Neutral, professional color palette

Fully responsive

Smooth but subtle JavaScript animations

Strong spacing and hierarchy

🧠 Critical Instruction

Before finalizing the build, ask me clear, checklist-style questions about:

Branding headline and tone

Preferred animation intensity

Deployment target confirmation

Which projects to highlight

Any constraints or exclusions

Wait for my responses before proceeding.

✅ Final Expectation

Deliver a production-ready portfolio website and GitHub repository that demonstrates:

Strong HTML/CSS/JS fundamentals

Clean, readable code

Real CI/CD pipeline implementation

Professional-grade presentation
